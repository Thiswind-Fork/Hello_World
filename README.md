# Hello World!
This repository contains the answers and examples published in conjunction with the book _Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners_ by Warren and Carter Sande (second, corrected printing April 2009).

It also includes files containing Python code written by Imogen Laurence while using the book. The original versions of these files were written for Python 2.5 as the book suggests. Subsequent versions were amended to run in Python 3.6.

In addition, there are some files written by Kevin Laurence to assit Imogen with her Kumon homework. Some of these files were also amended to work in Python 3.6.
